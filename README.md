Doing Android apps using Java was never easy till [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) stood at the door with Dart which now has enabled me to do apps for iOS too. At work am a [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) Developer doing desktop apps using C#. But then at times I fell short of the glory and started to redo what I do for desktop with C/C++. It wasn't easy working at first with [Qt](https://qt.io) framework though now I do [WxWidgets](htpps://wxwidgets.org) as a hobby and nothing serious about it.

 By they way, did I forget to mention that I love to [blog](https://medium.com/@JacksiroKe) when I am when I am bored with coding? I also chase wind or rather [cycle](https://www.strava.com/athletes/39986133) around the city when not debugging Cross Platform software especially on weekends. It helps a lot to refresh or rather reboot the exhausted mind. I think you should try it too to make you healthy and fit.
