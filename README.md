### Hi there, my name is Jack Siro.
- ðŸ”­ I am a self taught âœ¨ _software developer_ âœ¨ from Nairobi, Kenya with proven experience working with Laravel, Question2Answer, Joomla, Wordpress, Drupal frameworks in PHP and JavaScript. Doing Android apps using Java was never easy till Flutter stood at the door with Dart which now has enabled me to apps for iOS. At work am a .net Developer doing desktop apps using C#. But then at times I fell short of the glory and started to redo what I do for desktop with C/C++. It wasn't easy working at first with Qt framework though now I do Wx Widgets as a hobby and nothing serious about it.
- âš¡ I am familiar with packaging and deploying applications in Web, Android (Google Play Store), iOS (Apple Store), Windows(Windows Store) as well as cloud platforms such as Microst Azure and Amazon AWS, with a good understanding and experience with RESTful APIs.
- ðŸ˜„ I am also proficient with git version control tools and above all Object Oriented Programming principles.
- ðŸ“« Without forgetting I can be reached via the username âœ¨ _jacksiroke_ âœ¨ on all social media account or simply gmail that.
