- üî≠ I am a self taught _Software Developer_ from **Nairobi, Kenya** with proven experience working with **[Laravel](https://laravel.com)**, **[Question2Answer](https://question2answer.org)**, **[Joomla](https://joomla.org)**, **[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org)**, **[Drupal](https://drupal.org)**, **[Moodle](https://moodle.org)** frameworks in **PHP** and **JavaScript**. Doing Android apps using **Java** was never easy till **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev)** stood at the door with **Dart** which now has enabled me to do apps for iOS too. At work am a **[.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com)** Developer doing desktop apps using **C#**. But then at times I fell short of the glory and started to redo what I do for desktop with **C/C++**. It wasn't easy working at first with **[Qt](https://qt.io)** framework though now I do **[WxWidgets](https://wxwidgets.org)** as a hobby and nothing serious about it.
- ‚ö° I am familiar with packaging and deploying applications in **Web**, **[Android (Google PlayStore)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6588364181021070520)**, **[iOS (Apple Store)](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/jackson-siro/id1327275130)**, **Windows(Windows Store)** as well as cloud platforms such as **Microst Azure** and **Amazon AWS**, with a good understanding and experience with **RESTful** APIs.
- üòÑ I am also proficient with **git** version control tools and above all Object Oriented Programming principles.
- üì´ Feel free to reach me via the username **@jacksiroke**  on all social media account or simply **gmail** that.

 By they way, did I forget to mention that I love to **[blog](https://medium.com/@JacksiroKe)** when I am when I am bored with coding? I also chase wind or rather **[cycle](https://www.strava.com/athletes/39986133)** around the city when not debugging Cross Platform software especially on weekends. It helps a lot to refresh or rather reboot the exhausted mind. I think you should try it too to make you healthy and fit.
